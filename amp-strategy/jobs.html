            <h3>Efficiency</h3>
            <p>I need to spend my time building relationships with the right contacts involved in the right programs, not scouring disparate sources and cross-referencing info on organizations, programs, and contacts that <em>might</em> fit my ideal profile.</p>
            
            <p>The Marketing team runs campaigns to provide marketing qualified leads. I find the quality to be underwhelming, which leads me to performing my own searches (or I have to accept under-performance).</p>
            
            <h3>Quality and timeliness</h3>
            <p>I need to know out about the right leads* at precisely the right time so I can meet the buyer in their moment of need and beat competitive salespeople to the conversation.</p>
            
            <p>* The &#8220;right lead&#8221; is someone that </p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Is developing a product that is a technical match for my offer</li>
            <li>Is entering a stage in their program (or is planning for it) that requires my offer</li>
            <li>Has funding appropriate for the price of my offer</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Reduce pain and sense of failure</h3>
            <p>When performing my own search, I&#8217;m caught in a black hole of various broad research tools that offer lots of data and search criteria, but incomplete answers that are tedious to find and cross-reference. They also lack consistent methodology that would give me an easy way to compare and stack rank opportunities.</p>
            
            <p>I&#8217;m over-loaded, constantly on the move, and holding too much info in my head. I need to have a clearly ranked list of opportunities and contacts dropped in my lap so I can focus on deeply understanding the opportunity and the decision makers involved.</p>
            
            <h3>Professional super-powers (augmented selling)</h3>
            <p>Ideally, I would &#8220;just know&#8221; when a program is aligning to my offer and have immediate access to the contacts responsible for purchasing and influencing the purchase so I can stay focused on relationship selling and closing more deals.</p>
