<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p>I need to spend my time building relationships with the right contacts involved in the right programs, not scouring disparate sources and cross-referencing info on organizations, programs, and contacts that <em>might</em> fit my ideal profile.</p>

<p>The Marketing team runs campaigns to provide marketing qualified leads. I find the quality to be underwhelming, which leads me to performing my own searches (or I have to accept under-performance).</p>

<h3 id="qualityandtimeliness">Quality and timeliness</h3>

<p>I need to know out about the right leads* at precisely the right time so I can meet the buyer in their moment of need and beat competitive salespeople to the conversation.</p>

<p>* The &#8220;right lead&#8221; is someone that </p>

<ul>
<li>Is developing a product that is a technical match for my offer</li>
<li>Is entering a stage in their program (or is planning for it) that requires my offer</li>
<li>Has funding appropriate for the price of my offer</li>
</ul>

<p>When performing my own search, I&#8217;m caught in a black hole of various broad research tools that offer lots of data and search criteria, but incomplete answers that are tedious to find and cross-reference. They also lack consistent methodology that would give me an easy way to compare and stack rank opportunities.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m over-loaded, constantly on the move, and holding too much info in my head. I need to have a clearly ranked list of opportunities and contacts dropped in my lap so I can focus on deeply understanding the opportunity and the decision makers involved.</p>

<p>Ideally, I could &#8220;just know&#8221; when a program is aligning to my offer and have immediate access to the contacts responsible for purchasing and influencing the purchase so I can stay focused on relationship selling and closing more deals.</p>
