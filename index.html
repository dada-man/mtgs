## Strategy overview

----

### Primary context: Sales role

Looking for highly qualified leads.  
Not getting value from MQLs.  
Spending too much time on their own searches instead of selling.

### Secondary context: Marketing role

Trying to warm up the market for their Sales team.  
Campaign targeting isn't accurate enough -- leads are low quality.

### Goal

Sales teams can handle more opportunities and close more deals at the right price. 

The Market gets the right offers at the right time to successfully move their program forward.


## Jobs to be done

----

### Efficiency 

I need to spend my time building relationships with the right contacts involved in the right programs, not scouring disparate sources and cross-referencing info on organizations, programs, and contacts that *might* fit my ideal profile.

The Marketing team runs campaigns to provide marketing qualified leads. I find the quality to be underwhelming, which leads me to performing my own searches (or I have to accept under-performance).

### Quality and timeliness

I need to know out about the right leads* at precisely the right time so I can meet the buyer in their moment of need and beat competitive salespeople to the conversation.

\* The "right lead" is someone that  

- Is developing a product that is a technical match for my offer
- Is entering a stage in their program (or is planning for it) that requires my offer
- Has funding appropriate for the price of my offer

### Reduce pain and sense of failure

When performing my own search, I'm caught in a black hole of various broad research tools that offer lots of data and search criteria, but incomplete answers that are tedious to find and cross-reference. They also lack consistent methodology that would give me an easy way to compare and stack rank opportunities.

I'm over-loaded, constantly on the move, and holding too much info in my head. I need to have a clearly ranked list of opportunities and contacts dropped in my lap so I can focus on deeply understanding the opportunity and the decision makers involved.

### Professional super-powers (augmented selling)

Ideally, I could "just know" when a program is aligning to my offer and have immediate access to the contacts responsible for purchasing and influencing the purchase so I can stay focused on relationship selling and closing more deals.
